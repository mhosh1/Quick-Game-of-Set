# Gameofset-hosh.9

# - This is a text-based Ruby game where you can find sets of cards based on shape, color, number, and pattern.

# - A valid set is when, for each property, all three cards either share the same value or are all different an d none of the properties are the same.

# - To play, run ruby set_game.rb in your terminal.

# - The game will display 12 cards, and you need to choose 3 by entering their numbers (e.g., 1, 3, 5).

# - The game checks if your selection forms a valid set and replaces the cards if it does.

# - The game continues until the deck runs out of cards.

# - Hopefully you have fun finding sets and tracking your score!
